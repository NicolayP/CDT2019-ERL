# Dope demo:

    1. Launch ```roslaunch hello_tiago dope_demo.launch```
    2. Launch ```rosrun look_to_point look_to_point```
    3. Launch ```roslaunch dope dope.launch```

# Dope todo:

    add local dope config file somewhere and link it to when calling the dope roslaunch. Currentyl the path to the camera info inside the vanilla config file is pointing to the wrong topic name. Need to change this before runing dope with tiago.
